🔧 Project: Kynetik Electric
🎯 Goal: Keep all current backend logic, buttons, and functionality — but redesign the worker dashboard UI to look sharp, modern, and professional like ServiceTitan or Jobber.

⸻

✅ Key Design Changes to Make:

🎨 General Style Overhaul
	•	Switch to cleaner layout structure using CSS Grid or Bootstrap 5
	•	Use modern fonts like “Inter”, “Poppins”, or “Outfit” (Google Fonts)
	•	Apply drop shadows and card elevation for key sections
	•	Use soft gradients and icon overlays for status bars (like Jobber’s color blocks)

⸻

📱 Job Card Redesign
	•	Make each job card its own floating glassmorphic or frosted panel
	•	Use clean status badges (e.g. In Progress, Urgent) with icons
	•	Add:
	•	Clear job title at top (bold)
	•	Subtext for location + client
	•	Divider line
	•	Schedule info with icons (📍, 📅, ⏰)
	•	Job notes with read more/expand toggle
	•	Show job progress as a horizontal stepper bar with icons:
	•	Assigned ✅ → En Route 🚚 → Working 🔧 → Complete ✅

⸻

🧰 Action Buttons (Keep Logic, Style Visually)
	•	Update buttons to:
	•	Use rounded corners and slight hover animation
	•	Add icons (📝 Update, 📷 Add Photo, ☎️ Call, 💬 Notes)
	•	Use a 2x2 layout grid with spacing for mobile
	•	Keep Toolie button floating, but animate it with a glow or idle bounce
	•	Add subtle button loading states (spinner inside button when clicked)

⸻

📊 Top Dashboard Summary (optional)
	•	Top of page shows:
	•	✅ Completed: X jobs
	•	💼 Today’s Jobs: X
	•	⏱ Hours Worked: X
	•	💵 Earnings: $X.XX
	•	Use color blocks or gradient stripes with icons and smooth counters

⸻

🧭 Navigation
	•	Add slide-in sidebar (hamburger menu) with section links:
	•	My Jobs, Schedule, Route Map, Digital Forms, Job Photos, Time Log
	•	Optional: Show worker name, profile pic initial, and status badge (Available/On Break)

⸻

📁 Attachments & Notes
	•	Photos and notes show inline with expandable section per job
	•	Upload area should have drop zone or upload button
	•	Allow quick preview and delete (thumbnail gallery-style)
